	<h2>Google: More Creative</h2>
	<p>Google Inc. is an American multinational corporation specializing in Internet-related services and products. These include search, cloud computing, software, and online advertising technologies.[7] Most of its profits are derived from AdWords.[8][9]
	<p>Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University. Together they own about 16 percent of its shares. They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998. An initial public offering followed on August 19, 2004. Its mission statement from the outset was "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful",[10] and its unofficial slogan was "Don't be evil".[11][12] In 2006 Google moved to headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex.</p>
	<p>Rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products, acquisitions and partnerships beyond Google's core search engine. It offers online productivity software including email (Gmail), an office suite (Google Drive), and social networking (Google+). Desktop products include applications for web browsing, organizing and editing photos, and instant messaging. The company leads the development of the Android mobile operating system and the browser-only Chrome OS[13] for a netbook known as a Chromebook. Google has moved increasingly into communications hardware: it partners with major electronics manufacturers in production of its high-end Nexus devices and acquired Motorola Mobility in May 2012.[14] In 2012, a fiber-optic infrastructure was installed in Kansas City to facilitate a Google Fiber broadband service.</p>
	<p>The corporation has been estimated to run more than one million servers in data centers around the world[16] and to process over one billion search requests[17] and about 24 petabytes of user-generated data each day.[18][19][20][21] In December 2012 Alexa listed google.com as the most visited website in the world. Numerous Google sites in other languages figure in the top one hundred, as do several other Google-owned sites such as YouTube and Blogger.[22] Its market dominance has led to criticism of the company over issues such as copyright, censorship, and privacy.</p>

	<h2>Yahoo: More Interactive</h2>
	<p>Yahoo! Inc. is an American multinational Internet corporation headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. It is globally known for its Web portal, search engine Yahoo Search, and related services, including Yahoo Directory, Yahoo Mail, Yahoo News, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Groups, Yahoo Answers, advertising, online mapping, video sharing, fantasy sports and its social media website. It is one of the most popular sites in the United States.[3] According to news sources, roughly 700 million people visit Yahoo websites every month.[4][5] Yahoo itself claims it attracts "more than half a billion consumers every month in more than 30 languages."[</p>
	<p>Yahoo was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was incorporated on March 1, 1995. On July 16, 2012, former Google executive Marissa Mayer was named as Yahoo CEO and President, effective July 17, 2012.</p>
	<p>According to comScore, Yahoo during July 2013 surpassed Google on the number of United States visitors to its Web sites for the first time since May 2011, set at 196 million United States visitors, having increased by 21 percent in a year.</p>

	<h2>Bing: More Accurate</h2>
	<p>Bing (known previously as Live Search, Windows Live Search, and MSN Search) is a web search engine (advertised as a "decision engine"[2]) from Microsoft.</p>
	<p>Bing was unveiled by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer on May 28, 2009, at the All Things Digital conference in San Diego, California, for release on June 1, 2009.[3] Notable changes include the listing of search suggestions while queries are entered and a list of related searches (called "Explore pane") based on[4] semantic technology from Powerset, which Microsoft purchased in 2008.</p>
	<p>On July 29, 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo! announced a deal in which Bing would power Yahoo! Search.[6] All Yahoo! Search global customers and partners were expected to have made the transition by early 2012.</p>
	<p>In October 2011, Microsoft stated that they were working on new back-end search infrastructure with the goal of delivering faster and slightly more relevant search results for users. Known as "Tiger", the new index-serving technology has been incorporated into Bing globally since August 2011.[8] In May 2012, Microsoft announced another redesign of its search engine that includes "Sidebar", a social feature that searches users' social networks for information relevant to the search query.[9] In September 2013, a new-look Bing was released to tie-in with Microsoft's "Metro" design language.</p>
